# NYCC Arrests Data Analysis
An analysis of NYPD Arrests Data from 2018-2022. In our report, we answer the following questions:

1. Has the arrest rate been decreasing from 2018-2022?
2. What are the top 5 most frequent arrests in 2018-2022? 
3. If we think of arrests as a sample of total crime, is there more crime in precinct 19 (Upper East Side) than precinct 73 (Brownsville)?
4. Given the available data, what model would you build to predict crime to better allocate NYPD resources? What challenges do you foresee?

In gaining a better understanding of our past, we can evaluate our present laws and policing measures to better inform future policy changes. Ultimately, it is our hope that the insights in this report help fulfill both the Public Safety Committee and NYPDâ€™s mission to create better, safer communities for the citizens of New York City.
